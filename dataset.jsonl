There is much discussion about the activities and impact of Fab Labs from within the Fab and Maker communities, from stakeholders (such as policy makers and businesses) and from the media. Growth in Fab Lab numbers has been organic rather than directed. Fab Labs are set up by a wide range of people and organisations including individuals, entrepreneurs and businesses. The Fab Lab model is open — allowing those setting up Fab Labs to shape their labs — and the broader Fab community provides general resources and support for new and existing Fab Labs. As a result there is a fascinating diversity of FabLab forms and variation in their objectives and achievements.", "fablab":1}

There were two motivations behind me writing the guide. First, as an academic working on international business, entrepreneurship and innovation, Fab Labs were really interesting spaces for me to research. Between 2012-15 I worked on a project with my collaborator, Andrew Smith (University of Liverpool) which involved us spending time in Fab Labs in the UK, Spain and Japan. This research is being published in academic journals. I have since secured external research funding from the British Academy to investigate the growth of the additive manufacturing sector and its impact on manufacturing in general (for example, its impact on the geographies of where production takes place).", "fablab":1}

I wanted to give back to the Fab Community in return for the time given by Fab Lab managers and users who allowed me to interview them and to observe and engage with their Fab Labs. I also wanted to translate the knowledge I had gained of Fab Labs to help Fab Labs to maximise their huge potential to have a significant impact on the communities in which they are located (and beyond, as demonstrated by initiatives such as FabCity). This Guide will continue to be part of my research and I'll be tracking the impact the guide has on the Fab community.", "fablab":1}

{"text": "3D printing or additive manufacturing is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model.[1][2] It can be done in a variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined or solidified under computer control,[3] with the material being added together (such as plastics, liquids or powder grains being fused), typically layer by layer. ", "fablab":1}
{"text": "The umbrella term additive manufacturing (AM) gained popularity in the 2000s,[8] inspired by the theme of material being added together (in any of various ways). In contrast, the term subtractive manufacturing appeared as a retronym for the large family of machining processes with material removal as their common process. The term 3D printing still referred only to the polymer technologies in most minds, and the term AM was more likely to be used in metalworking and end-use part production contexts than among polymer, inkjet, or stereolithography enthusiasts. ", "fablab":1}
{"text": "By the early 2010s, the terms 3D printing and additive manufacturing evolved senses in which they were alternate umbrella terms for additive technologies, one being used in popular language by consumer-maker communities and the media, and the other used more formally by industrial end-use part producers, machine manufacturers, and global technical standards organizations. Until recently, the term 3D printing has been associated with machines low in price or capability.[9] 3D printing and additive manufacturing reflect that the technologies share the theme of material addition or joining throughout a 3D work envelope under automated control. Peter Zelinski, the editor-in-chief of Additive Manufacturing magazine, pointed out in 2017 that the terms are still often synonymous in casual usage,[10] but some manufacturing industry experts are trying to make a distinction whereby additive manufacturing comprises 3D printing plus other technologies or other aspects of a manufacturing process.[10]", "fablab":1}
{"text": "Other terms that have been used as synonyms or hypernyms have included desktop manufacturing, rapid manufacturing (as the logical production-level successor to rapid prototyping), and on-demand manufacturing (which echoes on-demand printing in the 2D sense of printing). The fact that the application of the adjectives rapid and on-demand to the noun manufacturing was novel in the 2000s reveals the long-prevailing mental model of the previous industrial era during which almost all production manufacturing had involved long lead times for laborious tooling development. Today, the term subtractive has not replaced the term machining, instead complementing it when a term that covers any removal method is needed. Agile tooling is the use of modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods to enable quick prototyping and responses to tooling and fixture needs. Agile tooling uses a cost-effective and high-quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs, and it can be used in hydro-forming, stamping, injection molding and other manufacturing processes.

{"text": "Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to vaporize materials, resulting in a cut edge. While typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, it is now used by schools, small businesses, architecture, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the laser beam to the material. A commercial laser for cutting materials uses a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas,[1] leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish.[2] ", "fablab":1}
{"text": "The laser beam is generally focused using a high-quality lens on the work zone. The quality of the beam has a direct impact on the focused spot size. The narrowest part of the focused beam is generally less than 0.0125 inches (0.32 mm) in diameter. Depending upon the material thickness, kerf widths as small as 0.004 inches (0.10 mm) are possible.[6] In order to be able to start cutting from somewhere other than the edge, a pierce is done before every cut. Piercing usually involves a high-power pulsed laser beam which slowly makes a hole in the material, taking around 5-15 seconds for 0.5-inch-thick (13 mm) stainless steel, for example. ", "fablab":1}
{"text": "The parallel rays of coherent light from the laser source often fall in the range between 0.06-0.08 inches (1.5-2.0 mm) in diameter. This beam is normally focused and intensified by a lens or a mirror to a very small spot of about 0.001 inches (0.025 mm) to create a very intense laser beam. In order to achieve the smoothest possible finish during contour cutting, the direction of the beam polarization must be rotated as it goes around the periphery of a contoured workpiece. For sheet metal cutting, the focal length is usually 1.5-3 inches (38-76 mm).[7]\nAdvantages of laser cutting over mechanical cutting include easier work holding and reduced contamination of workpiece (since there is no cutting edge which can become contaminated by the material or contaminate the material). Precision may be better since the laser beam does not wear during the process. There is also a reduced chance of warping the material that is being cut, as laser systems have a small heat-affected zone.[8] Some materials are also very difficult or impossible to cut by more traditional means.

In addition, those who identify with the subculture can be found at more traditional universities with a technical orientation, such as MIT and Carnegie Mellon University (specifically around 'shop' areas like the MIT Hobby Shop and CMU Robotics Club). As maker culture becomes more popular, hackerspaces and Fab Labs are becoming more common in universities[15] and public libraries.

By designing open technologies and developing new businesses, Chinese makers make use of the system, make fun of it, altering it and provoking it. DIY makers often bring and align contradictory ideas together, such as copycat and open source, manufacturing and DIY, individual empowerment and collective change. In doing so, they craft a subject position beyond the common rhetoric that Chinese citizens lack creativity.
